# Optimizing an LSTM self-attention architecture for Portuguese Sentiment Analysis using a Genetic Algorithm
Python code made publicly available to replicate the methodology reported in the article `Optimizing an LSTM self-Attention architecture for Portuguese Sentiment Analysis using a Genetic Algorithm`, published in the MDPI Applied Sciences journal.

# Dataset
The dataset is available in Mendeley Data repository, with the DOI 10.17632/448d7kts3k.1. You can freely downloaded.

The PT-EN Zomato Dataset is a set of half a million Portuguese restaurant reviews and approximately 24 thousand English reviews reviews. The dataset has a total of 1192173 rows with information about the restaurant where the review was given and a rating score from 1 to 5 stars. Not all the entries provide a text review. 

These data was collected by Zomato Portugal (now known as Dig-In) and made available during a founded research. The data corresponds to the period from April 1st, 2014 to September 2nd, 2022. 

The dataset provides several columns. The relevant columns for this study are:
- review_id;
- text;
- rating;
- text_language;
- text_translation_pt;
- text_translation_en.
